**AXiA** is an innovative interactive web platform that transforms **NASA exoplanet data from TESS and Kepler** into **educational, engaging, and AI-generated insights**. The project addresses a key challenge: making complex astronomical data **accessible and understandable to the general public**, while demonstrating how AI can enhance **science communication and education**.



## Project Overview

AXiA allows users to select any exoplanet from a dynamic dropdown menu. Upon selection, the platform generates a **natural-language description** of the planet's characteristics, including:

- Radius  
- Orbital period  
- Transit duration  
- Potential habitability  

These descriptions are produced in real-time using **Mistral AI**, which interprets raw data and converts it into **simplified, scientifically accurate, and educational narratives**. Sequential “scanning” messages create an immersive experience, simulating the process of **analyzing exoplanets like a professional astronomer**.



## Problem Solved & Innovation

Raw NASA exoplanet datasets are **dense and technical**, making them difficult for non-specialists to understand. AXiA solves this problem by:

1. Using **AI to generate accessible educational content**, allowing users to quickly grasp complex astronomical concepts.  
2. Providing **interactive visualizations and animations** to enhance engagement.  
3. Offering **real-time, tailored descriptions** for each exoplanet, increasing curiosity and learning.  

The innovative aspect lies in the combination of **AI-driven text generation, real astronomical data, and interactive design**. AXiA transforms static data into a **dynamic, educational, and enjoyable learning experience**.



## Use of Artificial Intelligence

AXiA uses Mistral AI exclusively for generating educational, plain-language descriptions of exoplanets based on NASA TESS and Kepler datasets.
	•	All AI-generated text is clearly labeled in the UI.
	•	AI is not used to modify NASA branding or copyrighted material.
	•	AI enables real-time, personalized descriptions, making technical data understandable and engaging.

This ensures transparency and compliance with NASA Space Apps Challenge rules.



## Educational Impact & Benefits

- Makes complex astronomical data accessible to students and the public.
- Serves as a teaching tool for STEM education and classroom demos.
- Encourages curiosity and exploration of space science through interactive experiences.
- Demonstrates how AI can bridge the gap between raw scientific data and public understanding.


## 🛠 Technologies

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI for API endpoints  
- **AI:** Mistral AI for generating natural-language exoplanet descriptions  
- **Data sources:** NASA TESS and Kepler datasets
